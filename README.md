In this updated version, the argument documentation in the `Usage` section is formatted as a Markdown list. The descriptions of each argument are written as bullet points under the available arguments. Replace `--option1`, `--option2`, and `--option3` with the actual argument names in your project, and update the descriptions accordingly.
